# Tools-Rainfall_Discharge_Sim

These models has been built within the framework of KARMA Project.

This folder contains 4 Multiphysics models that simulates rainfall-discharge hydrodynamics

Model1: Simulate flow in three dimensions by assuming an overlying diffuse layer representing the lag generated by the epikarst and vadose zones
Model2: Simulate flow in two dimension for a vertical cross section with a diffusive recharge condition
Model3: Simulate flow in two dimension horizontally using diffusive recharge condition
Model4: Simulate flow in two dimension horizontally using Concentrated recharge condition
